## Inspiration
We believe it is important to give back to the community especially when it is in our area of expertise. 

## What it does
Our application will help organizations share client information and services between each other. They will also be able to assess data analytics to improve their future decisions. 

## How we built it
We used Ruby, and Ruby on Rails to develop a web application. By utilizing these languages we can provide our application on a variety of devices.

## Challenges we ran into
Hardware limitations and getting the project going. SMS carries also seemed daunting. There are over a thousand carriers and it makes it difficult to reliably send a message to the client. Our hardware issues were with Matthews machine and getting Rails running on it. Since we were unable to get Matt up and running, He and I(Joey) shared my laptop. You will find many commits to a Branch called "Matt_branch" and a few to master that he committed. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were all very pleased with our progress despite of our limited hardware and human resources.

## What we learned
From not reassessing our hardware issues and not taking advantage of Hackathon resources we realized we couldn't fully develop our project to our initial estimation. 

## What's next for 54 Characters
We would love to Integrate Volunteer opportunities into the application after finishing the User system, Organizational metrics, and a prevention contact form.
